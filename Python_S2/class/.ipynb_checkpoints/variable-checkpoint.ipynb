    "A variable in Python is like a key in a dict that refers to a value. Once a variable is declared and assigned to a value, it will be saved into a space named **nameplace** where all variables are saved.\n",
    "Imagine `a = 5000000000`, what we actually want is the int 5. The reason why we assign it a name/variable is because it's convenient to name a data with an alias to do more things. It's not interesting to use a value directly and it's time wasting. We do not want to waste time on writing a same value once and once if we want to use it in many cases.\n",
    "And the value itself, it's more than a value for computer. For human, number is the abstract concept of the real, numbers are arbitraire symboles. 5 can mean 5 in decimal, but 0101 can aussi mean 5, five can also mean 5. So the sign 5 is just another name for the concept of 5. \n",
    "For computer, it works in the same way. Computer does not need to know what 5000000000 means. It just needs to know that something exists, no matter what it is. So, for computer, to know something exists, it needs to remember it in part of its memory and give this part a name which is called adresse. \n",
    "So once we declare a variable and assign a value to it, we actually assign the adresse to it, so that the variable points works as a pointer of adresse guiding computer find what contains the adresse. Variables are saved in a the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that a variable points to an adresse is called 映射"
